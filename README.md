# SpongeCase
Python 3 script to take a string from the command line, and convert it to a mixed case string like is popular in the dumb Spongebob meme

`This script will work with Python 2 if you change the user input from input() to raw_input(). Python 3 treats this differently and handles apostrophes and punctuation gracefully but it'll fail with a syntax error in Python 2.`

When run on the command line this turns your input into a mixed case string that you can use to mock your foes online!

- Input: `This is an example, of what this swell script will do y'all!`
- Output: `tHiS iS aN eXaMpLe, Of WhAt ThIs SwElL sCrIpT wIlL dO y'AlL!`


Have fun and enjoy!
